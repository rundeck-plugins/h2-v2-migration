# Security notes:
# 1. This repository contains only shell scripts and configuration files
# 2. The migration.sh script downloads H2 JAR files at runtime from Maven Central
# 3. No package manager dependencies (npm, pip, maven, etc.) are used
# 4. Security scanning focuses on shell script best practices and file permissions
# 5. Users should verify H2 JAR integrity using checksums when running migration
